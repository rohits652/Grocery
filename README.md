Hi, I am Rohit, a passionate developer from India. I am currently working on GroceryList webapp (https://grocerylistapp.azurewebsites.net/). I am currently learning Flask framework for this project. I hosted this webapp using Azure webapp services. For any interaction you can mail me on rohitsonwane652@gmail.com. All my projects are available on https://github.com/rohit652. You can also connect me through my LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohitsonwane652/.

This webapp is helpful to make a list of grocery items just by adding the items in the list. We can even easily remove the items just by selecting the item and clicking the check items button.
